    "Title": "Over 50 Tory MPs in northern England press PM for roadmap out of lockdown",
    "Summary": "Joint letter from group expresses fears that election pledge to 'level-up' is being abandoned",
    "Body": "More than 50 Conservative MPs in northern England have thrown down the gauntlet to Boris Johnson, urging him to provide a \u201Cclear roadmap\u201D out of lockdown and arguing that the Covid pandemic \u201Chas exposed in sharp relief the deep structural and systemic disadvantage faced by our communities\u201D.\r\n\r\nIn a provocative letter from the Northern Research Group, which is led by former northern powerhouse minister and Johnson ally Jake Berry, the 55 MPs express fears that the government\u2019s \u201Clevelling up\u201D is being abandoned. Forty-one are named, many from former \u201Cred wall\u201D seats, and 14 are anonymous.\r\n\r\nMore regions were placed under the most severe coronavirus restrictions on Monday, meaning 8.2m people in England \u2013 one in seven \u2013 will soon be living under tier 3, forcing the closure of pubs, bars and other parts of the hospitality sector. Of these, 92% are in the north of England.\r\n\r\nMore than 2m people in West Yorkshire could join them by the weekend after local leaders met ministers on Monday to discuss further measures to combat soaring cases. A further 20,890 UK cases and 102 deaths were confirmed, with a further 1,142 hospitalised \u2013 though weekend numbers are often lower.\r\n\r\nThe letter published on Monday expresses concerns \u201Cthat the cost of Covid could be paid for by the downgrading of the levelling-up agenda, and northern constituencies like ours will be left behind\u201D.\r\n\r\nThe MPs write: \u201CWe believe this would threaten to undermine the government\u2019s hard-won mandate in December, at a time when the political and economic case for the levelling-up agenda we have been elected to deliver, has never been more essential.\u201D\r\nThey argue the north of England has seen a level of disruption \u201Cunparalleled\u201D with other parts of the country. \u201CThe virus \u2026 threatens to continue to increase the disparity between the north and south still further. Northern parts of our country were among the first to be significantly adversely affected by the Covid outbreak and now many communities have been put back under severe restrictions,\u201D they add.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nThe group asks the prime minister to create \u201Ca pathway down the tiering system\u201D and to accelerate key road, rail and social infrastructure projects, and job creation. He should develop \u201Ca tailored economic recovery plan\u201D for the north, they say.\r\n\r\nThe MPs remind Johnson of a speech he gave on 30 June in Dudley, in the West Midlands, claiming \u201Cwe must use this critical moment to address the problems we have collectively failed to tackle for decades\u201D.\r\n\r\nAll are under significant pressure from constituents furious that the government refused to extend free school meals over half term, with only one signatory (Jason McCartney, MP for Colne Valley) voting against the government on the policy last week.\r\n\r\nJake Berry\u2019s Rossendale and Darwen constituency has been under local lockdown measures for months and is now under tier 3 along with the rest of Lancashire.\r\n\r\nBerry said: \u201COur party\u2019s return to government in December was won on the back of hard-working people in constituencies like ours who backed the Conservatives for the first time in a generation, and who did so on the promise that they would not be forgotten.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe cannot forget that we must deliver on our commitments made during that election, to level-up northern communities and create opportunity across our region.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnother signatory, William Wragg, MP for Hazel Grove in Stockport \u2013 which went into tier 3 as part of Greater Manchester last week \u2013 said: \u201CWe have long needed a good deal for the north from the government and the virus has only exacerbated that need.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis isn\u2019t about giving government a tough time - the prime minister shares our collective priority. But there are compelling and constructive arguments we, as a group of northern MPs, can make to government about how it delivers on its promise to level up the north.\u201D\r\n\r\nTier 3 restrictions will come into force at 12.01am on Tuesday for Warrington in Cheshire and 12.01am on Thursday for Nottingham and its commuter suburbs of Rushcliffe, Gedling and Broxtowe, it was confirmed on Monday. The rest of Nottinghamshire will remain in tier 2.\r\n\r\nThe new measures mean all pubs and bars must close unless they are serving \u201Csubstantial meals\u201D. Alcohol can be served only with food. Additional closures include betting shops, adult gaming centres, casinos and soft play centres.\r\n\r\nInfection rates in Warrington are among the highest in the country and continue to rise, with case rates at 361 people per 100,000 \u2013 double the England average of 180.6.\r\n\r\nThough Nottingham\u2019s younger population was initially worst hit, rates have now increased to 217 per 100,000 in over-60s, a 20% rise on the previous week, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said.\r\n\r\nLeaders in West Yorkshire met senior government ministers and the deputy chief medical officer on Monday to discuss whether their region should also enter tier 3. In a statement afterwards, they said: \u201CThe latest data on infections and hospital admissions shows a continued rise, and we have repeated our calls to government that further local action needs to be taken, including strengthening community engagement and test and trace. There will be further discussions with government in the coming days.\u201D",

    "Title": "Treasury rejects claims it refused extra 150m GBP for free school meals",
    "Summary": "Education secretary Gavin Williamson did not ask for funds for half-term, say officials",
    "Body": "The row at the heart of government over free school meals was laid bare on Monday night when the Treasury insisted Gavin Williamson had never asked for the extra money to fund the half-term extension.\r\n\r\nTreasury sources said there had been no request from the education secretary for the \u00A3150m to provide meals for 1.4 million disadvantaged pupils during the holiday.\r\n\r\nThey indicated that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was irritated at the suggestion his department was to blame for a row that has led to splits in the Tory party and accusations the government is failing to support some of the poorest children in the country.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere was nothing proposed or mentioned from the Department for Education,\u201D one source said.\r\n\r\nSpeaking on Monday as a campaign by the footballer Marcus Rashford continued to gain momentum, Boris Johnson hinted that a replacement scheme could be devised in time for the Christmas holidays.\r\n\r\nBut the prime minister also pointed to a \u00A363m local council fund as a resource for local authorities to pay for the poorest children to have meals over half-term, prompting a backlash from local leaders.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that virtually all councils have now spent the bulk of their allocation from the \u00A363m, which was intended to cover a range of Covid-19 hardship areas.\r\n\r\nThe government\u2019s own guidance on the money, which was provided on 10 July, said: \u201CThe government anticipates that most of the funding will be spent within 12 weeks.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Local Government Association said demand for help had \u201Coutstripped this funding now\u201D and that councils that were providing meals were doing so out of their own budgets.\r\n\r\nFollowing days of vehement criticism after the government\u2019s refusal to extend free schools meals in England for the current half-term and over Christmas, Johnson said: \u201CWe don\u2019t want to see children going hungry this winter, this Christmas, certainly not as a result of any inattention by this government \u2013 and you are not going to see that.\r\n\u201CWe will do everything in our power to make sure that no kid, no child goes hungry this winter during the holidays. That\u2019s obviously something we care about very much.\u201D\r\n\r\nGovernment sources said they were examining an expansion of children\u2019s access to holiday activity clubs including meals, though Treasury sources denied they had been asked to examine any concrete proposals. Last year about 50,000 disadvantaged children used the holiday activities and food scheme.\r\n\r\nLocal government leaders blamed the Treasury for the hold-up in expanding the scheme before its spending review but Treasury sources said the Department of Education had never submitted any formal request for more funds to cover half-term meals.\r\n\r\nAnger is continuing to rise among prominent Conservatives. The mayor of Tees valley, Ben Houchen, became the latest senior Tory to break ranks with the government, calling it \u201Cwrong\u201D not to fund the meals and launching his own local support.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not going to let party politics get in the way of doing what is right,\u201D he said. \u201CIn a time of major crisis it\u2019s obvious that we should support our most vulnerable children and I think the government is wrong not to extend this scheme into the October half-term. I hope the government reconsiders their decision.\u201D\r\n\r\nMPs are fuming about Downing Street\u2019s strategy because of the damage done to the party, blaming both Johnson and Williamson, who has so far avoided the brunt of the criticism.\r\n\r\nThe Tory MP George Freeman, a former health minister and head of Theresa May\u2019s policy unit, also urged the government to change tack by Christmas, saying he regretted his \u201Cmistake\u201D in voting against free school meals over half-term.\r\n\r\n\u201CHaving funded \u2018eat out to help out\u2019 this summer, I cannot see why the \u00A320m cost of free school meal vouchers for half-term is prohibitive,\u201D he said, adding that the government should \u201Caccept we misjudged the mood and got this wrong last week\u201D.\r\n\r\nHe added: \u201CPolitics isn\u2019t just about doing the right thing but being seen to do the right thing and reinforcing the best values of our nation through this crisis.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhilst there are genuine policy challenges with how to target the right help through the benefits system to those most in need \u2013 this week when parents face half-term without school meals \u2013 is not the time to have the debate. The immediate priority should be avoiding any child going hungry.\u201D\r\n\r\nOther MPs privately said the strategy to defend the refusal to back Rashford\u2019s campaign had been a mistake. One Conservative MP talked of receiving at least 100 angry emails about the vote last week \u2013 when the motion to extend free school meals was voted down \u2013 and knew colleagues who had been sent many more.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is this growing worry about a tendency to get ourselves into dead ends and then have to eventually do a U-turn,\u201D the MP said. \u201CIt\u2019s not just No 10 not engaging properly with MPs, it\u2019s departmental ministers too, and they really should be acting as a bridge with MPs.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Department for Education is seen as one of the worst for this, and they\u2019ve had a lot of U-turns. Their junior team is pretty inexperienced, and it\u2019s often them who should liaise with MPs and pick up on things. The tone is set by No 10, but a good secretary of state makes sure they do all this properly, and Gavin [Williamson] has lost a lot of credibility in the last six months or so.\u201D Williamson came under intense fire amid the exam results fiasco over the summer.\r\n\r\nAnother Tory MP said strategists in No 10 were too obsessed at not bowing to press pressure which meant they would often walk into \u201CLabour-laid traps\u201D. One frontbencher said they believed the government strategy was to appeal only to the voters of \u201Cred wall\u201D Tory MPs, many of whom had been vocal critics of extending free school meals.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe communications is inept but this is fundamentally an ideological battle. It is about appealing to those voters who believe parents should take responsibility and a lot of those are actually working-class voters,\u201D the minister said. \u201CThe red wall MPs are hardcore on this stuff.\u201D",

    "Title": "CBS releases footage of Trump walking out of 60 Minutes interview",
    "Summary": "US president halts recording after question about his use of social media and name-calling",
    "Body": "Footage of the US president abruptly walking out of a CBS 60 Minutes interview has been released by the network, in a row that has been rumbling since the interview was taped on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump had already posted clips on his own social media, in an effort to show he had been mistreated by the interviewer, Lesley Stahl. He had called the segment \u201Cfake\u201D and \u201Cbiased\u201D in advance.\r\nTrump had told Stahl: \u201CYou brought up a lot of subjects that were inappropriately brought up.\u201D She replied: \u201CWell, I said, I\u2019m going to ask you tough questions.\u201D\r\n\r\nAfter a question about whether his use of social media and name-calling was \u201Cturning people off\u201D, Trump brought the recording to an end. He answered: \u201CNo, I think I wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t have social media. The media is fake. And frankly, if I didn\u2019t have social media, I\u2019d have no way of getting out my voice.\u201D\r\n\r\nA few moments later, he told his aide Hope Hicks: \u201CI think we have enough of an interview here, Hope. OK? That\u2019s enough. Let\u2019s go.\u201D\r\nThe 60 Minutes interviews with both Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, drew a total of 16.8 million viewers, the biggest audience for the show since an interview two years ago with Stormy Daniels, the adult film actor and producer who claims an affair with Trump in the past, which the president denies, and was paid hush money during the 2016 election, Variety reported.\r\n\r\nTrump had also tweeted during the week complaining that Stahl had not been wearing a mask in the White House. CBS said Stahl wore a mask at all times except during and for a few moments after the interview, and had tested negative for coronavirus before arriving to interview the president.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many, though, the clips did not give the impression that Trump was trying to convey \u2013 that he had been treated unfairly by CBS.\r\n\r\nJon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Barack Obama, said Trump came across as \u201Cweak and pathetic\u201D and \u201Ca whiny, aggrieved baby\u201D.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s no longer even pretending to fight for his supporters against liberals, immigrants, the media, elites, the establishment. Donald Trump is fighting for Donald Trump. That\u2019s it.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd Amy Siskind, who wrote a book on Trump\u2019s first year in office, said: \u201CAll he did was lie and obfuscate, and when he was called on it he got up and sulked out.\u201D\r\n\r\nThere was also criticism in some quarters that Stahl had avoided some of the more difficult questions she could have asked the president about his finances, the treatment of immigrant children separated from their parents at the US border by his administration, and the number of people involved in his campaign who have subsequently been charged with crimes.\r\nA CNN factcheck of the president\u2019s contribution showed he made at least 16 false or misleading claims during the interview.\r\n\r\nIn another segment of the CBS 60 Minutes special before the election, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, went on record to say she believed Trump was racist.\r\n\r\nAsked: \u201CDo you think the president is racist?\u201D by the host, Norah O\u2019Donnell, the California senator replied: \u201CYes, I do. You can look at a pattern that goes back to him questioning the identity of the first black president of the United States. You can look at Charlottesville, when there were peaceful protesters, and on the other side, neo-Nazis, and he talks about fine people on either side. Calling Mexicans rapists and criminals. His first order of business was to institute a Muslim ban. It all speaks for itself.\u201D",

    "Title": "Sunak under pressure to reveal whereabouts of his own investments",
    "Summary": "Opposition MPs say chancellor should reveal if any of his 'blind trust' wealth is held offshore",
    "Body": "The chancellor is under pressure to reveal where his multimillion-pound personal fortune is invested after suggestions that some of his wealth, which is managed by a so-called blind trust, could be held in offshore tax havens.\r\n\r\nOpposition MPs and transparency campaigners on Monday called on Rishi Sunak to be \u201Ccompletely transparent\u201D about where his wealth \u2013 earned over a long career at the US investment bank Goldman Sachs and hedge funds \u2013 is invested in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest with his role running the UK economy.\r\nSir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: \u201CThe truth with this trust is that the only people that are blind to it are the public. The chancellor only set up the trust 18 months ago but the public has no idea where the money is or whether there is a conflict of interest. With public trust in this government plummeting, greater transparency in all their dealings is essential and the chancellor must show a lead.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nSunak registered a blind trust in July 2019 after he had been appointed chief secretary to the Treasury under the previous chancellor, Sajid Javid. Under a standard blind trust arrangement individuals can still receive income from their investments but cannot make decisions about how the money is invested.\r\n\r\nThe campaigners and MPs are concerned that Sunak will know where his money was invested before he placed it in the blind trust, and that raises concerns that his decisions as chancellor could be influenced by his personal stakeholdings.\r\n\r\nThe financial transparency campaigners have also called on the chancellor to be categorical on the question of whether any of his wealth is sheltered in offshore tax havens.\r\n\r\nAbena Oppong-Asare, the shadow exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201CRishi Sunak needs to be completely transparent with the public about whether any of the funds he invested in a blind trust are held in offshore tax havens. Taxpayers paying their fair share expect nothing less.\u201D\r\n\r\nSunak is the only chancellor to have used a blind trust since details of ministers\u2019 interests began to be published in 2009. Seven serving ministers hold a blind trust, compared with 13 in 2015.\r\n\r\nRichard Murphy, a visiting professor of accounting at Sheffield University management school and a self-described \u201Ctax justice campaigner\u201D, said: \u201CThe problem with this arrangement is that the blindness is for the public. We literally know nothing.\u201D\r\nDaniel Beizsley of the financial transparency campaign group Spotlight on Corruption said: \u201CThe issue as I see it with Sunak is that unless the trustee was given specific instructions to diversify the portfolio, then Sunak is fully aware of its contents. It\u2019s difficult to see how this could absolve him of conflict of interest claims. Additionally, by placing assets into the blind trust arrangement, the public\u2019s ability to judge potential conflicts is reduced as his ministerial declaration is now empty.\u201D\r\n\r\nSunak\u2019s spokesperson refused to comment, but a Treasury source said: \u201CBlind trusts\/blind management arrangements are longstanding mechanisms for protecting ministers in the handling of their interests. They ensure ministers are not involved in any decisions on the management, acquisition or disposal of items in the arrangement.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\n\u201CPoliticians of all stripes have used blind trusts\/blind management arrangements to ensure they avoid any conflict of interest, including the last Labour government.\u201D\r\n",

    "Title": "Polish pro-choice protests continue with blockades and red paint",
    "Summary": "Thousands march in opposition to ruling that could lead to near total ban on abortions",
    "Body": "Thousands of protesters turned out in towns and cities across Poland on Monday as a political crisis sparked by an impending near total ban on abortion showed no sign of abating.\r\n\r\nDrivers created a series of blockades in city centres and thousands of people marched to express their anger at a ruling by Poland\u2019s constitutional tribunal that, if implemented, would ban terminations even in instances where a foetus is diagnosed with a serious and irreversible birth defect.\r\n\r\nIn Warsaw, activists poured red paint across the \u0141azie\u0144kowski Bridge. According to the All-Poland Women\u2019s Strike, which is coordinating the actions, protests were held in more than 150 towns and cities in Poland, as well as elsewhere in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Poland\u2019s far-right government is pushing abortion underground\r\nRead more\r\n\u201CPoles have already forgiven this government so many different scandals, but we won\u2019t forgive this attack on the freedom and dignity of women,\u201D said Julita, 33, who works in finance and attended Monday\u2019s protests in Warsaw. \u201CForcing us to give birth to sick, deformed foetuses, causing such suffering to mothers and children, is barbarism taking Poland back to the middle ages. A line has been crossed and we are not going to back down.\u201D\r\n\r\nMarta Kotwas, a researcher at UCL\u2019s School of Slavonic and Eastern European Studies specialising in rightwing populism in Poland, said: \u201CThere is so much anger because people can see how the abortion issue is being exploited as a political issue, how women are being used as a bargaining chip by political actors.\u201D\r\nAt the weekend protesters in several towns and cities picketed and in some instances disrupted church services, amid signs that the anger felt by many Poles about the the Catholic church\u2019s role in public life was spilling over into open confrontation.\r\nAt the Church of the Holy Cross in central Warsaw on Sunday, pro-choice protesters clashed with far-right activists, and one woman was taken away in an ambulance after allegedly being thrown down the steps in front of the church.\r\n\r\nThe far-right leader Robert B\u0105kiewicz announced that nationalist groups would create a \u201Cnational guard\u201D to defend churches from the protesters.\r\n\r\nKotwas said: \u201CWe are seeing an alignment between the political authorities, the church and militant rightwing groups. It is really scary.\u201D\r\n\r\nThere have been signs that social groups not traditionally aligned with Poland\u2019s pro-choice movement are mobilising in support of the protests. On Sunday, farmers in the small northern town of Nowy Dw\u00F3r Gda\u0144ski formed a procession of tractors, and on Monday a miners\u2019 union declared that \u201Ca state that assumes the role of ultimate arbiter of people\u2019s consciences is heading in the direction of a totalitarian state\u201D.\r\nAnger has been exacerbated by reports that doctors wary of breaking the law have already started to cancel scheduled terminations of foetuses with severe defects. On Friday the management of the Biela\u0144ski hospital in Warsaw issued a directive to its department of gynaecology and obstetrics warning it not to carry out scheduled procedures. A spokesperson for Warsaw\u2019s mayor later clarified that procedures would continue until the tribunal\u2019s ruling comes into force.\r\n\r\nIn 2016 Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the leader of Poland\u2019s ruling rightwing Law and Justice party, declared that \u201Cwe will strive to ensure that even in pregnancies which are very difficult, when a child is sure to die, strongly deformed, women end up giving birth so that the child can be baptised, buried and have a name\u201D.\r\n",

    "Title": "Survey uncovers widespread belief in 'dangerous' Covid conspiracy theories",
    "Summary": "False claims that pandemic is a hoax or was started deliberately are attracting adherents around world",
    "Body": "Significant numbers of people around the world believe Covid-19 was created deliberately, has killed far fewer people than reported, or is a hoax and does not actually exist, according to a global survey.\r\n\r\nAlong with belief in other conspiracy theories \u2013 such as that the world is run by a secret cabal \u2013 the YouGov-Cambridge Globalism Project, a survey of about 26,000 people in 25 countries designed in collaboration with the Guardian, found widespread and concerning scepticism about vaccine safety.\r\n\r\nAmong the most widely believed Covid conspiracies is that the death rate of the virus, which according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker has so far killed nearly 1.1 million people worldwide, has been \u201Cdeliberately and greatly exaggerated\u201D. Nearly 60% of respondents in Nigeria said this was definitely or probably true, along with more than 40% in Greece, South Africa, Poland and Mexico. About 38% of Americans, 36% of Hungarians, 30% of Italians and 28% of Germans felt the same.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence the coronavirus pandemic has prompted some people to say they trust experts more, but it has also triggered a wave of disinformation and fake news propagated by science deniers and conspiracy theorists that has spread virally on social networks.\r\n\u201CAny scary event \u2013 a pandemic, a mass shooting \u2013 that denies people a sense of control will lead to a proliferation of conspiracy theories,\u201D said Stephan Lewandowsky, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Bristol who is an expert on misinformation.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\n\u201CThey give people a sense of psychological comfort: the feeling that they are not at the mercy of randomness. They\u2019re dangerous at any time, but more so in a pandemic if they lead people to ignore official advice, or commit acts of vandalism or violence.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut conspiracy theories also thrived on \u201Cgovernments\u2019 inability to have a clear message\u201D, said Lewandowsky. \u201CThey are another reason why we all need clear, consistent, evidence-based policymaking that can be trusted.\u201D\r\n\r\nAmong other countries, roughly one in four French and one in five British and Spanish respondents believed the death rate of the virus had been exaggerated, while Australians, Swedes and Japanese were more likely to dismiss such a belief.\r\n\r\n\r\nGet Society Weekly: our newsletter for public service professionals\r\n Read more\r\nSignificant numbers also thought the virus had been \u201Cdeliberately created and spread\u201D by the Chinese or US government, while in Poland one in five people believed it was definitely or probably a complete myth, created by unidentified \u201Cpowerful forces\u201D. Roughly the same proportions in Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia said they agreed with that proposition, while in the US the figure reached 13%.\r\n\r\nThe false claim that 5G mobile technology is to blame for the spread of Covid-19 also has plenty of adherents, according to the survey, which was conducted in July and August.\r\n\r\nMore than a fifth of respondents in Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and South Africa believed it was definitely or probably true that symptoms were \u201Ccaused or enhanced by the direct, physical effects on the human body\u201D of 5G.\r\n\r\nMore than half of Nigerians, more than 40% of South Africans, Poles and Turks, more than 35% of Americans, Brazilians and Spaniards and between one in four and one in five French, British, Italian and German respondents believed it was definitely or probably true that Covid-19 had been deliberately created and spread by the Chinese government.\r\n\r\nSignificant numbers also thought the US government was responsible for creating and spreading the virus: as many as 37% of respondents in Turkey, against one in five in Greece and Spain, 16% in Poland, 12% in France and just 5% in the UK. About 17% of American citizens said they believed it was definitely or probably true that their own government was to blame.\r\n\r\nThe survey also tested belief levels in common non-Covid conspiracy theories, finding between 20% and 30% support in 10 countries \u2013 including South Africa, Brazil, Hungary and Poland \u2013 for the belief that manmade global heating was \u201Ca hoax invented to deceive\u201D.\r\n\r\nSimilar proportions thought the moon landings were faked, while between 20% and 30% of respondents in Spain, France, the US, Italy and Germany thought the US government \u201Cknowingly helped make the 9\/11 terrorist attacks happen\u201D. Between 20% and 44% of people in 17 countries believed or thought it likely that humans had made contact with aliens.\r\n\r\nThe most widely held conspiracy theory by some distance, however, was that despite who may officially be in charge of national governments and other organisations, there was \u201Ca single group of people who secretly control events and rule the world together\u201D.\r\n\r\nThis was held to be \u201Cdefinitely or probably true\u201D by more than 20% of respondents across 20 countries, including 28% of Britons, 36% of French respondents, 37% of Americans, 45% of Italians, 47% of Poles, 55% of Spaniards, 68% of South Africans and 78% of Nigerians.\r\n\r\nThe survey revealed widespread and significant anti-vaccination sentiment, a matter of serious concern to many governments that hope soon to be able to inoculate their populations against Covid-19.\r\n\r\nAcross 19 different countries 20% or more of respondents said they gave at least some credibility to the view that \u201Cthe truth about the harmful effects of vaccines is being deliberately hidden from the public\u201D, including 57% of South Africans, 48% of Turks, 38% of French people, 33% of Americans, 31% of Germans and 26% of Swedes.\r\n\r\nWhile the UK was among the countries with the lowest rates of anti-vaccination sentiment, almost one in five people \u2013 19% \u2013 still agreed either wholly or partially with the statement. Research by the Guardian recently found engagement with anti-vaccination content on Facebook had trebled in a month.",

    "Summary": "Many firms may not last to see a promised 'serene Christmas', as pandemic bites across Europe",
    "Body": "From ski resorts in the north to restaurants in the south, many Italians have been making their objections heard to the government\u2019s latest measures to combat escalating coronavirus infections.\r\n\r\nThe prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said the restrictions, which include the 6pm closure of bars and restaurants and complete closure of gyms, swimming pools, cinemas, theatres and ski stations, were needed so that people could enjoy a \u201Cserene Christmas\u201D.\r\n\r\nBut the holiday period will be far from serene for businesses already reeling from the impact of the country\u2019s spring shutdown and that might never reopen. \u201CA calm Christmas is impossible,\u201D said Paolo Bianchini, a restaurant owner in the Lazio town of Viterbo and president of MIO, a hospitality sector association.\r\nBars and restaurants are the lifeblood of the economy for so many Italian cities and towns, particularly in the south. In Sicily, for example, the number of restaurants has grown by 50% over the last eight years, according to figures from Unioncamere-Infocamere, an agricultural union.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s an injustice and a final blow that we didn\u2019t deserve,\u201D said Giada Penna, who owns Il Mirto e la Rosa restaurant in Palermo.\r\n\r\nBianchini estimates that 50% of restaurants, which were already operating at reduced capacity, will not open at all over the next month as the cost of doing so will far outweigh revenues.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe would like to know on what scientific basis it was decided to close restaurants,\u201D he said. \u201CWe have done everything possible to work safely, for our own health and for that of our families too. So we would like to know if there is data that proves we are the spreaders.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe government has promised a funding package for businesses affected by the measures, which will be in place until 24 November. \u201CWhat matters now is how much and when. We need the support quickly,\u201D added Bianchini.",

    "Title": "Anger spreads in Islamic world after Macron's backing for Muhammad cartoons",
    "Summary": "Calls for boycott of French goods after president's remarks at tribute to murdered teacher Samuel Paty",
    "Body": "France has appealed for foreign governments to stamp out calls by what it calls a \u201Cradical minority\u201D for a boycott of French products after Emmanuel Macron\u2019s public backing of the Muhammad caricatures.\r\n\r\nThe appeal came as anger escalated across the Islamic world over the president\u2019s remarks at a national tribute to the murdered high-school teacher Samuel Paty last week, with Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011Fan, calling on Monday for a complete boycott of French products in Turkey.\r\n\r\nPaty, 47, was killed after he showed his class drawings of the prophet during a debate on free speech.\r\n\r\nAfter Macron promised France would not \u201Crenounce the caricatures\u201D, a furious riposte that emerged on Friday on social media under Arabic hashtags gained momentum over the weekend.\r\nIn a strongly worded statement, France\u2019s foreign ministry demanded that calls for a boycott of its products and the \u201Coccasionally hateful\u201D protests against the country must end.\r\n\r\n\u201CThese calls distort the positions defended by France in favour of freedom of conscience, freedom of expression, freedom of religion and the refusal of any call to hatred,\u201D it read.\r\n\r\n\u201CConsequently, the calls for boycott are pointless and must cease immediately, as must all attacks against our country, instrumentalised by a radical minority.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe statement added: \u201CThe ministers and our entire diplomatic network are fully mobilised to remind and explain to our partners France\u2019s positions, particularly with regard to fundamental freedoms and the rejection of hatred, to call on the authorities of the countries concerned to dissociate themselves from any call for a boycott or any attack against our country, to support our companies and to ensure the safety of our compatriots abroad.\u201D\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, after protests in which the president\u2019s picture was burned and Erdo\u011Fan, suggested his French counterpart needed \u201Chis mental health tested\u201D, Macron also responded.\r\n\r\n\u201COur history is one of a battle against tyranny and fanatacisms. We will continue,\u201D Macron tweeted in three languages, French, English and Arabic.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe respect all differences in a spirit of peace. We will never accept hate speech and we defend reasonable debate. We will continue. We hold ourselves always on the side of human dignity and universal values,\u201D the French president added.\r\n\r\nTurkey, Iran, Jordan and Kuwait are among Islamic countries to criticise the publication of the caricatures, which originally appeared in France in Charlie Hebdo, sparking a terrorist attack on the satirical newspaper in 2015 that killed 12 people.\r\n\r\nThe Organisation of Islamic Cooperation also denounced the \u201Csuggestions of certain French leaders \u2026 that risk submerging French-Muslim relations\u201D.\r\n\r\nWhile condemning \u201Call acts of terror in the name of religion\u201D it attacked the \u201Ccontinued publication of blasphemous cartoons\u201D of the prophet.\r\n\r\nMuslims have also been angered by Macron\u2019s comments earlier this month that Islam is \u201Ca religion that is in crisis all over the world today\u201D. The comments were made when the French president announced his long-awaited law against \u201Cseparatism\u201D aimed at combatting radical Islam in France, expected to be presented to the French parliament in December. The influential university-mosque, al-Azhar in Cairo, Egypt, described Macron\u2019s statement as \u201Cracist\u201D.\r\n\r\nIn Qatar, certain food distribution groups announced they were removing French products from their shops for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, French cultural week planned at the Qatar University has been postponed because of a \u201Cdeliberate attack on Islam and its symbols\u201D.\r\n\r\nIn Kuwait, French cheeses \u2013 La Vache Qui Rit and Babybel \u2013 have been removed from some stores. About 430 Kuwaiti travel agents have reportedly suspended reservations for flights to France.\r\n\r\nPakistan also criticised France on Sunday, with the prime minister, Imran Khan, accusing Macron of \u201Cattacking Islam\u201D by encouraging the publication of caricatures of Muhammad.\r\n\r\nMasood Khan, the president of Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir, tweeted: \u201CPresident Macron has ignobly earned a patent for #Islamophobia and incitement to hatred against Muslims. We condemn his blasphemous words and the mindset behind them. France suffered from such a mindset during WWII. Why does he inflict similar injury on others?\u201D\r\n\r\nAfter Erdo\u011Fan criticised Macron directly, saying \u201CGo and get your mental health tested\u201D, Paris recalled its ambassador to Ankara and responded that the comment was \u201Cunacceptable\u201D. It accused Turkey of \u201Cwhipping up hatred\u201D against France.\r\n\r\nAs the backlash over France\u2019s reaction widened, European leaders rallied behind Macron. \u201CThey are defamatory comments that are completely unacceptable, particularly against the backdrop of the horrific murder of the French teacher Samuel Paty by an Islamist fanatic,\u201D German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2018s spokesman Steffen Seibert said.\r\n\r\nThe prime ministers of Italy, the Netherlands and Greece also expressed support for France, as did European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, Erdogan called for a complete boycott of French products in Turkey, saying: \u201CNever give credit to French-labelled goods, don\u2019t buy them.\u201D he also compared the treatment of Muslims in Europe to that of Jews before World War II, saying they were the object of a \u201Clynching campaign.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn Israel, about 200 people gathered in front of the French embassy to condemn Macron. In Gaza, Palestinian protesters burned photos of the French president.\r\n\r\nPolice shot dead Abdullah Anzorov, 18, after he allegedly beheaded Paty 10 days ago. Investigators say the suspect had communicated with two people from an Islamist group in Syria but add there is no evidence the attack was ordered from abroad.\r\n\r\nPolice believe the Russian-born Chechen, who lived in \u00C9vreux, Normandy, became radicalised of his own accord but are looking into a sports club and two mosques he frequented in recent months.\r\n\r\nFrance\u2019s anti-terrorism prosecutor confirmed on Thursday that seven people, including two pupils at Paty\u2019s school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, had been charged with terrorism offences.\r\n\r\nPaty was posthumously awarded the L\u00E9gion d\u2019honneur, France\u2019s highest honour, at a ceremony at Sorbonne University in Paris on Wednesday. Macron said France owed it to a \u201Cquiet hero \u2026 to continue his fight for liberty and for reason\u201D.\r\n\r\nPaty showed the class the images of Muhammad alongside other caricatures and cartoons of different subjects as part of a discussion on free speech, after inviting any pupils who might be offended to look away.\r\n\r\n",

    "Body": "Pressure on the UK government is growing after its own advisory committee on social mobility came out in support of Marcus Rashford\u2019s campaign to extend free school meals, while a former Ofsted chief said the cost was small compared with the amount spent on consultants.\r\n\r\nThe social mobility commission, an agency of the Department for Education, said it was urging the government to extend the free meals during school holidays until Covid-19 restrictions were lifted, as part of a wider move to combat child poverty.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe know that the current pandemic is having its greatest impact on the poorest regions in Britain where people are already struggling to afford food for their families,\u201D said a spokesperson.\r\n\r\nCiting the commission\u2019s research from earlier this year, which showed that 600,000 more children were in poverty than in 2012, they added: \u201CWe believe the government should do all it can to start reversing that trend. It should begin by ensuring that all children are properly fed. But it needs to go much further. We now need a much more ambitious programme to combat child poverty.\u201D\r\nHe told the Guardian: \u201CIt\u2019s clear that there are a lot of children who have suffered already a great deal during the pandemic and whose family circumstances have actually worsened over the months.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt would also be a small amount of money in comparison to what has gone, for example, into the furlough scheme or indeed what is paid to consultants.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe government has spent more than \u00A3210bn in response to the coronavirus pandemic, including more than \u00A3175m on consultants. Funding \u00A315-a-week food vouchers for the 1.4 million children registered to receive free school meals would cost about \u00A321m a week.\r\n\r\nThe intervention of another respected voice came as the campaign by Rashford, the England footballer, was bolstered by heavyweight corporate support.\r\n\r\nThis included Prezzo, Weetabix, Nestle, Hovis bread and Sainsbury\u2019s, which tweeted that it was \u201Cproud to stand\u201D with Rashford\u2019s taskforce as it set out to eliminate child food poverty.\r\n\r\nRashford\u2019s club, Manchester United, also stepped in on Monday as part of a partnership with the food charity FareShare, a founding member of his taskforce, which will result in 5,000 meals being cooked and delivered to local school children each day this week.\r\n\r\nFood provided by FareShare will be made into individual meals by staff at the club\u2019s Old Trafford ground\u2019s kitchen facilities and shipped to local Manchester United Foundation partner schools.",

    "Body": "The definition of dog heaven is straightforward enough: bottomless biscuits, walks on demand, squirrels you can actually catch.\r\n\r\nWhether it exists is a thornier question. But according to a new study, owners of all kinds of domestic animals have become more likely to believe in a pet afterlife \u2013 and have used gravestones and memorials to express their faith that they will one day be reunited.\r\n\r\nA new analysis published in the journal Antiquity, examining the history of pet cemeteries in Newcastle and London over 100 years from 1881, found an increase in the proportion of graves that reference the animals\u2019 immortal souls.\r\n\r\n\u201CFew 19th-century gravestones reference an afterlife, although some may \u2018hope\u2019 to see their loved ones again,\u201D said Dr Eric Tourigny, author of the study, who looked at more than 1,000 animal headstones. \u201CBy the mid-20th century, a greater proportion of animal gravestones suggest owners were awaiting a reunion in the afterlife.\u201D\r\nmages of gravestones included in the paper show simple 19th-century references to \u201CTopsey, loving friend\u201D, \u201COur dear wee Butcha\u201D, and \u201CDarling Fluff\u201D. In the few cases where an afterlife is referenced, owners are careful not to challenge contemporary Christian orthodoxy and only suggest a hope of reunion.\r\n\r\nBut by the 1950s, the owner of \u201CDenny\u201D, a \u201Cbrave little cat\u201D, adds firmly: \u201CGod bless until we meet again.\u201D In the same era, religious references become more common \u2013 with symbols like crosses and \u201Cepitaphs invoking God\u2019s care and protection\u201D.\r\n\r\nTourigny, a lecturer in historical archaeology at Newcastle University, found other evidence that pet owners were increasingly likely to view animals as part of the family. He wrote that an increasing number of gravestones used family names after the second world war \u2013 though \u201Csome early adopters of surnames put them in parentheses or quotation marks, as if to acknowledge they are not full members of the family\u201D.\r\n\r\nHe also found that owners would increasingly often refer to themselves by familial pronouns like \u201CMummy\u201D, \u201CDad\u201D, or \u201CAuntie\u201D.\r\n\r\nTourigny said that while it was difficult to quantify precisely, most of the stones \u201Care likely for dogs\u201D \u2013 but the proportion of cats and other animals grew as the 20th century went on.\r\n\r\nGravestones in the four pet cemeteries examined cover burials from the 1880s to the 1980s. Since then, cremation has become more common for those who wish to mark their pet\u2019s death.\r\n\r\nTourigny \u2013 who has only ever owned two goldfish himself, but has recently adopted two cats, which arrive next week \u2013 told the Guardian that one of the most notable recent trends was that jurisdictions around Britain were \u201Callowing humans and animals to be co-buried for the first time\u201D.\r\n\r\nOther modern pet memorial services include paw prints cast in clay, framed collars, and even the chance to turn their ashes into diamonds. But many owners still opt for the simpler approach of burying them in the back garden \u2013 or what is euphemistically termed \u201Ccommunal pet cremation\u201D.\r\n\r\nWhile religious views around the world vary, Christianity has traditionally held that animals have no hope of an afterlife. But Pope John Paul II said in 1990 that animals do have souls and are \u201Cas near to God as men are\u201D.\r\n\r\nSome pet lovers viewed remarks by Pope Francis in 2014 as offering further hope of furry eternity. He said that \u201Cwhat lies ahead \u2026 is not an annihilation of the universe and all that surrounds us. Rather, it brings everything to its fullness of being, truth and beauty.\u201D",

    "Summary": "Murphy says she wants to set record straight, but Jewish group dismisses her claims as smearing",
    "Body": "Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s former chief of staff has said she is proud of Labour\u2019s record on antisemitism, days before the equalities watchdog is expected to publish its report on the issue.\r\n\r\nKarie Murphy, one of Corbyn\u2019s fiercely protective inner circle, whom several former party staffers have accused of meddling in antisemitism cases, said she had been moved to speak out \u201Cfor the first time \u2026 [to] set the record straight\u201D about the party\u2019s handling of cases, claiming that it improved during Corbyn\u2019s tenure.\r\n\r\n\u201CUnder Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, antisemites were removed from the Labour party more quickly, transparently and effectively than ever before. As his former chief of staff, I\u2019m proud of that record,\u201D she has written in a piece for the Guardian.\r\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is expected to publish its long-awaited report on Labour this week. It launched the review after whistleblowers alleged that the party was institutionally antisemitic in its handling of complaints and within local party structures.\r\n\r\nAny key figures who are criticised in the report, who could include Murphy, are likely to have been given some limited sight of its findings in advance.\r\n\r\nMurphy said there had been an \u201Cextremely successful campaign to obscure the facts\u201D about how the party handled complaints, claiming it was \u201Cprimarily driven by political opposition to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s socialist, internationalist politics\u201D and procedural failings.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not speaking out for the first time to dismiss the fact that antisemitism reared its head among a small minority in the Labour party. It did. It was wrong and the party as a whole was slow to deal with it effectively,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\nBut in comments that were fiercely opposed by the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM), Murphy said a \u201Crelentless and highly politicised media campaign\u201D was also to blame. It \u201Churt Jewish people and disturbed and confused many in our movement,\u201D she said. \u201CCould more have been done earlier? Yes, of course. But what was done \u2013 including changes to the party\u2019s rules and instituting detailed guidance on antisemitism for an expanded complaints team \u2013 unquestionably made it easier and swifter to remove antisemites from the party.\u201D\r\n\r\nMurphy said she was \u201Cdeeply sad\u201D that relations with the Jewish community were at such a low ebb during Corbyn\u2019s tenure. \u201CBut it wasn\u2019t for want of trying, let alone because of any tolerance of antisemitism.\u201D she wrote.\r\n\r\nWhistleblowers who worked in Labour\u2019s governance and legal unit, several of whom went public to speak to the BBC Panorama programme, have previously said senior party staff fatally undermined their attempts to tackle antisemitism, alleging consistent interference in complaints, which Murphy denies. Several staff described experiencing breakdowns as a result of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nMurphy cited an audit of more than 300 antisemitism complaints received by the party from November 2016 to February 2018, which found that only 34 had been investigated. She alleged that changes brought about by Jennie Formby as general secretary \u2013 Formby has since left the role \u2013 led to a fourfold increase in expulsions per case.\r\n\r\nMurphy said she and other staff members in the Labour leader\u2019s office did not meddle in cases involving party members, saying she saw it as \u201Ca factional trap\u201D when she was asked for advice \u2013 a claim strongly disputed by former staff members, who have claimed they were put under inappropriate pressure in prominent cases.\r\n\r\nMike Katz, chair of the JLM, said Murphy\u2019s claims were a smear of Jewish members. \u201CJLM referred Labour to the EHRC because our efforts to engage constructively with the party from 2015 onwards had been rebuffed constantly and our members faced continued discrimination, harassment and victimisation,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CAt no point was there genuine remorse, improvements to the system, or any real progress in the number of cases handled or outcomes. Their only success on antisemitism was the rigour with which they protected their political allies, downplayed the issue and gaslit those who spoke up against it. Smearing the pain of our members and the wider Jewish community as part of a \u2018highly politicised media campaign\u2019 is shameful.\u201D",
